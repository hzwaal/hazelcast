# Hazelcast demo

This project provides a demo project for experimenting with Hazelcast. Basically, it provides a console shell
where you can type various commands to interact with the cluster. Simply start the application multiple times
on the same LAN to start the cluster. Type `help` to see a list of commands.

- The `master` branch contains the Scala version, which uses Hazelcast 3.x
- The `Java` branch contains the Java version, which uses Hazelcast 4.x (that does not have matching Scala wrappers)
